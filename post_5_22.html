            <p class="blog_para">I am writing this late at night because I feel inspired to and 
                I feel as if I will not if I wait until tomorrow morning to start writing. 
                This is not one of those things that you “sleep on”. I’m going to write it now. 
            </p>

            <p class="blog_para">I feel as if the Lord has called me to pursue entrepreneurship and app development. 
                It just seems like all the pieces in my life align toward that calling. I’m majoring in computer science. 
                I learned how to start something from scratch by creating a student-led newspaper (PolyTechTalk) in high school. 
                I’m enrolled in an entrepreneurship program in college (xFoundry) that will require me to make an app next year. 
                I’ve long had an interest in web development and always thought websites and apps were cool. And it’s something 
                that my dad has encouraged me to pursue as well. 
            </p>

            <p class="blog_para">He mentioned to me last summer the idea of developing an app that would help people find nonprofits 
                in Baltimore city. There’s definitely a need. Baltimore is home to many small non-profits and many people who could use 
                the services they have to offer. However, many people remain hungry and without clothes and on the streets despite the 
                existence of many non-profits that are working to offer food and clothing and shelter. Because these organizations struggle 
                to get the word out about what they do, many people remain unserved. And so that’s where our app idea comes in. Someone in 
                need (or someone close to them) could open up the app, type in their need, and find a non-profit close by that offers the 
                good or service that they need for cheap or at a low-price. The problem isn’t that the goods and services aren’t available. 
                It’s that people can’t find them. Just writing this out now makes me motivated to go and build that app out. And I want to do 
                that. I (Lord willing) plan on building it out this summer. But it won’t be easy and thinking about the process discourages me. 
            </p>

            <p class="blog_para">App development is hard. Starting at my first xCode file was daunting. There was so much that I didn’t understand. 
                So much new syntax, so much new stuff I didn’t know. Tonight, I tried using an AI code-writing tool called Cursor in the hopes of 
                making App Development simpler. I asked it to make an app the simulates major league baseball games. By the way, I had already 
                created a web app to do that , but I wanted a mobile version. And Cursor spat out a thousand lines of code but I when I tried 
                to run it I would get an error every time. I would paste in the error messages to Cursor and run again, but each time I would 
                get a new error or even the same error. Eventually, I kept getting the same error messages over and over again and so I gave up. 
                I was inspired to use Cursor after watching the YouTube videos that say “I built this app in 1 day”. But, as always, when I tried 
                doing what they did on the app on my own device, I ran into problems that I didn’t anticipate. It’s never as easy as it seems.

        <div class="blog_side_by_side">
            <p class="blog_para">And so I started to doubt. Is App Development really right for me? Do I really want to spend hours staring 
                at a computer screen? Do I really want to learn all of this new syntax? Can I learn all of this new syntax? Am I cut out for it? 
                How am I gonna learn how to make a database and manage a database and make a UI and make a backend and integrate all of these 
                things together? How am I gonna debug the many errors that will inevitably occur? How am I gonna get non-profits on the app and 
                make sure that their info is up to date? I have so many questions and the thought of building this thing out is so daunting, but 
                yet I feel called to it still. And the process seems biblical. God doesn’t make things easy. Spiritual growth occurs through 
                trials, through suffering. Good things don’t come easy, and they wouldn’t mean as much if they did. And so I plan on pushing 
                through one step at a time. I surrendered myself to God and I seek his guidance as I journey along this path. And I know I cannot 
                do it alone. I need wisdom from God and from others who have built apps and solved problems and started businesses before me. 
                I’ll need to work with my Dad and with Pastor Ron and with others who are connected with the non-profit landscape in Baltimore. 
                I’ll have to talk to people I don’t know and conduct interviews. I’ll have to get out of my comfort zone. But I know I can do it 
                because the Lord is with me and he has already equipped me with many of the skills I need. I trust that he will provide the rest 
                if it’s in his will.

        </div>

        <p class="blog_para">And so I plan on doing it. I don’t have a detailed plan about how I’ll go about making this thing and I know 
            I’ll have hard moments. I know I’ll have to pivot at times. I know I’ll continue to doubt. I know I’ll have to ask for help. 
            But that’s life. That’s the nature of our faith. We just have to keep on pushing, putting one foot in front of the other. 
            I’ll have to take baby steps and be encouraged by the small achievements. It won’t come easy, but through consistent effort, 
            progress will be made.
