            <p class="blog_para">After writing my last post, I soon traveled to Uganda for a mission trip that spanned two weeks. 
                It was a wonderful time. I was away from technology for those two weeks and surrounded by people that I love from my 
                college campus ministry, OneU. I traveled with 11 other people from the ministry and we saw many things that I’ve never 
                seen in the States. People living in utter poverty. But also people who were very joyful despite their difficult circumstances. 
                I learned so much during that trip and was put in some challenging, uncomfortable situations. We had long days of serving after 
                getting very little sleep. Some of us led devotionals at the guest house, others of us taught bible lessons in the classroom 
                (myself included). But we were treated so well. From the wonderful food in the guest home cooked by Jaja (grandmother in Ugandan) 
                to the warm welcomes we received at the primary and secondary schools to the way that children would gravitate towards us wherever
                we went, we were treated like royalty over there. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_side_by_side">
            <p class="blog_para">It really is hard to describe in words the love that the locals gave us out there but it was truly amazing. 
                On one hand I felt honored to be greeted with wonderful dance performances and beautifully coordinated songs when we’d visit 
                a new location. It was cool when kids would run up to me and want to hold my hand and hug me and hear me talk about America. 
                But after some time it felt weird. I wondered why these people were treating me like a celebrity when I was an ordinary person 
                just like them. And it just goes to show you how much of an impact money has on the way we view people. I know that hospitality 
                and treating your guests well is a hallmark of Ugandan culture, but the way they treated us was over the top (mostly in a good way). 
                I wonder how much of that was due to the novelty of us being from America and how much was due to them wanting money from us or 
                just admiring us for having money. I know that if I were in their shoes I would probably react similarly, just as I would react 
                if a group of American celebrities showed up to my home tomorrow. And yet I also know that God calls us to treat everyone as equal. 
                In fact, we are to prioritize those who are overlooked by society. The Book of James says that God has honored the poor and he 
                has humbled the rich. It says that if we show favoritism, we “sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers”. And so in my heart, 
                I felt like something was off, even though it felt good to be treated so well by these people.

            <p class="blog_para">I also had a very surreal day where the Holy Spirit put in on my heart to confess to Drew, my campus ministry leader,
                 that I was somewhat afraid of him and had always been very reserved around him because of that. That was not something I wanted to 
                 say to him, but the Spirit really put it on my heart. I felt very uneasy and restless in my heart one night and it continued into 
                 the next day when we went to church. At church, it was hard for me to focus because of this restlessness in my heart. And I knew 
                 what the Lord was calling me to do the whole time. During the service, the pastor called out at one point, “I feel like something 
                 in this room is preventing the Lord from getting through”. He said something about a “roadblock”. And it genuinely felt like he 
                 was calling me out at that moment. I was pushing back against the Lord’s call for me to speak to Drew. I could have done it the 
                 previous night. And actually, now that I think about it, the first opportunity was at the dinner table the previous night. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog_para">We were doing an encouragement circle, where people would chime up and encourage someone else at the table. 
                It was then, when there was a lull in the conversation, a pause for a good 5 seconds, that I first felt the Lord calling on 
                me to give Drew a word of encouragement. But I was too afraid to for whatever reason. And I rejected the call of the Spirit. 
                And so that is what caused my restlessness for the rest of the night and the next day. And so, back to church. 
           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog_side_by_side">
            <p class="blog_para">There was a time during the service when the pastor called the elders to come up to the front and he and the elders 
                prayed for members of the church who were sick or dealing with things. By the way, I think that is a wonderful church practice. 
                I felt the Lord really calling me then to go up and get prayed for. But I resisted it. Nobody else from OneU was getting up to 
                get prayed for. I wasn’t sick. I felt like I didn’t need it as much as these other people. And yet the feeling in my heart 
                remained. And so, after resisting the Spirit for what seemed like an eternity (ok maybe not an eternity), I finally went up 
                there. When the Pastor laid his hands on my head, I felt like I was weightless. It felt like I was falling backwards and I 
                needed to hold myself up. I told myself mentally that I should probably just surrender to the Spirit in that moment and not 
                try to keep myself up, but I didn’t want to actually fall backwards and make a fool of myself. And so I worked to keep myself 
                standing. I can’t say I felt that much different after he prayed for me, but it was a surreal experience nonetheless. I 
                remember smiling as I walked back to where I was sitting previously. Jake (my OneU mentor) smiled at me and gave me a thumbs up. 
                And then, soon after I sat down, the pastor called me up to the pulpit again.
                <br> 
                <br>
                He started asking me questions like “Why did you come to church today?” and “What are you studying”. I gave 
                pretty generic answers to those questions. And then he pulled me in close and whispered in my ear, “You will be a person of 
                influence. God will use you to influence people in a good way”. I can’t definitively say if he was speaking on behalf of the Lord,
                 but I’d like to think that he was. And given the circumstances with the Spirit calling me to go up there and get prayed for, 
                 I have to believe that that was a message from the Lord. I even hesitate to put something like that on a blog post, as it seems 
                 like something I should just keep to myself. But I already told the people on the mission trip about it and so I’ll just post it here.

            <p class="blog_para">Ultimately, I ended up giving Drew encouragement at the table and having a nice conversation with him later. 
                It still doesn’t make sense to me today why I was scared of him. Even now it’s weird interacting with him because he’s probably 
                trying to come off in a way such that I won’t be intimidated, and thus can’t be his natural self. And so I’ve questioned if I 
                should have done what I did but it clearly was something the Lord wanted me to do and it allowed me to grow in vulnerability 
                and courage. 
           </p>
           <p class="blog_para">Overall, the trip was very meaningful and it challenged me to grow in many ways. I learned so much from the locals 
            and from the people I served with. I learned to approach uncomfortable situations with courage, to pray without ceasing, and to rely 
            on the Lord’s strength in times when it felt like I was being “poured out like a drink offering”. I’m grateful that the Lord provided 
            me with this opportunity and I hope that more people in the States are able to experience what I experienced in those two weeks.
